OBJECTS
    What?   Object are variable that can store many values
    Why?    We use object to store many properties for 1 thing
            EX: Car -> numberOfWheels, numberOfSeats, engineType, color, model
    How?
            Objects contain fields
            A field is made of [a name + a value]
            Declaration:
                let array = []
                let array = [2,20,-10]

                let object = {}     //declaring an empty object
                let object = {
                    color : "red",
                    numberOfWheels : 4,
                    isRunning: true
                }
            Reading a value
                object.color -> "red"
            Adding a field to the object
                let object = {}
                object.color = "red"
                object.model = "Tesla"
            
            Remove a field from the object
                delete object.color
