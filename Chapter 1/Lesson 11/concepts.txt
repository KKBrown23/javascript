Functions
    EX: prompt()    -> taking input
        log()       -> display vaules to the console
        random()    -> generate a random number 0-1

    What?   
            Functions are small programs that help to:
                a. divide the program into smaller programs
                b. reduce the code length
                c. make the code more readable
    Why?
            Write once, use twice
            [you can write a function one time and use it as many times as you needs it] 
    How?
            1. Defining a function using 4 parts        [Defining ONCE]

                    a. function         (keyword)
                    b. name of function (it needs to start with a verb)
                    c. parameter part       (what does the function need to know before it starts)
                    d. body             (this is the calculation part)

                    e. return           (this is the "output" part)

                    EX: function addTwoNumbers(number1, number2){
                            let sum;
                            sum = number1 + number2;
                            return sum;
                    }
            
            2. Calling a function using 2 parts         [Using TWICE]

                    b. name of function
                    c. parameter part

                    let sum1 = addTwoNumbers(34,3);
                    let sum2 = addTwoNumbers(334,-1);
                    let sum3 = addTwoNumbers(4,60);
                    let sum4 = addTwoNumbers(67,580);
HW:
    1. // write a function that takes as parameter 2 numbers and returns the smallest of them
    2. Write a function that generates and returns a random number
    3. Write a function that takes a name and returns "Hello" + the name
    4. Write a function that takes 2 numbers and return true if
         their product is the same as their sum, else returns false
