What we learnt:
1. how to take input from a user
    a. Declare an input element at HTML 
    b. Select this element at JS
    c. Register a listener to this element
    d. Take the value at the handler using inputElement.value

2. Changing the text of an HTML element.
    a. Select the Element.
    b. Change the text using Element.innerText.

3. Calling a function every X seconds. 
    a. Use setInterval to repeat a function every X seconds.
        e.g setInterval(myFunction, 1000).
        The set interval function takes two arguments, the function that we want to run and the time in miliseconds.

4. We keep a variable called "state" to keep track of things that change (e.g the points, time, highscore etc.)
    Everytime the state variable changes we have to show it to the user by changing the html element.
