Operators 
    1. Math operators: +, -, *, /
            +=      => increment
            -=      => decrement
    2. Comparision operators             [ true / false ]
        1. >  greater than
        2. <  less than
        3. <= less or equal than
        4. >= greater or equal than
        5. == is equal
        6. != is not equal

    3. Logical operators
        1. &&   AND         will return true if and only if both the conditions are true
        2. ||   OR          will return true if any of the conditions is true

IF statment
    1. if
    2. (condition)
    3. {body}           ->will be executed if the condition is true

    4. else{}           ->will be executed if the condition is false

Loop statment
    1. for
    2. (startingPoint; endingPoint; step)
    3. {body}

    When using loops:
        a. How many reps?
        b. based on the reps define  (startingPoint; endingPoint; step)
        c. build the body 
    EX: 5 reps
        startingPoint   : 0
        endingPoint     : 5
        step            : +1

        0,1,2,3,4  => 5 reps
    
    What to include inside the body?
        console.log("Hello World");
