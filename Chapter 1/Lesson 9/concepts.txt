Loop statment
    1. for
    2. (startingPoint; endingPoint; step)
    3. {body}

    When using loops:
        a. How many reps?
        b. based on the reps define  (startingPoint; endingPoint; step)
        c. build the body 
    EX: 5 reps
        startingPoint   : 0
        endingPoint     : 5
        step            : +1

        0,1,2,3,4  => 5 reps
    
    What to include inside the body?
        console.log("Hello World");

Solving problems with loops that CHANGE

    When something changes every step of the loop:
        1. decalre a variable outside the loop
        2. use this variable inside the loop
        3. change the variable inside the loop
    
    
    print 2,4,6,...20

    let evenNumber = 2;
    for(let counter = 0; counter < 10; counter += 1){
        console.log("Step" + (counter+1));
        console.log(evenNumber);
        evenNumber += 2;
    }

Generating Random numbers 
    let randomNumber = Math.random() * 100;         
    randomNumber = Math.floor(randomNumber);        //gets the decimal part away
